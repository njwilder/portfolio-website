About: 
My name is Noah Wilder and I enjoy working on and solving a wide variety of problems. 
Whether I am working on more theoretical Computer Science problems that come about 
from code and system specifications, or I am working towards achieving personal projects


My name is Noah Wilder and I enjoy solving complex problems and expanding my 
knowledge base around many different fields.




One of my greatest joys in life is learning how things work and solving problems.
The more intimidating a problem is, the harder I will strive towards understanding 
and solving that problem. This ambition naturally attracted me to the field of 
Computer Science and coding more recently in my life. I enjoy continuously learning 
and solving the problems that come about from coding, as well as making those 
solutions readable and supportable.
