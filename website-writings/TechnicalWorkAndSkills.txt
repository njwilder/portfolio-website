Technical Work:
While full time in college and working a part time job, I worked generally 40-80 hour work weeks at the InterOperability Laboratory at UNH. During that time, I spent every waking second of my time that wasn't spent on college assignments, studies, or my other job working on many of the various projects and issues being worked on at the IOL's Datacenter department. Datacenter was responsible primarily for developing test scripts for the NVMe SSD specification utilizing the libnvme public library to ensure drive conformance for various vendors. It was interesting going from someone who didn't know anything about anything that was going on (and was hoplessly lost in the lab environment), to what I would like to think would be a critical member of the department in the period of two years. I learned as much as I could and put 110% into every single day I worked and it was genuinely a once in a lifetime experience getting to understand the people I worked with and crafting this project together.
