About:
My name is Noah Wilder: I love software development (other things).

One of my greatest joys in life is learning how things work and solving problems.
The more intimidating or difficult a problem is, the harder I will strive towards 
understanding and solving that problem. This ambition naturally attracted me to 
the field of Computer Science and coding. I enjoy continuously learning and solving 
the problems that come about from coding, as well as making those solutions as 
supportable and clean as possible, while also squeezing the best performance from 
a given system possible. 


MORE DETAILED ABOUT:
"For fortune and glory, kid. For fortune and glory..."

I am continually fascinated by the use of abstraction in computing to achieve some of 
the most impressive feats in human history.

I have been a video game junky since I could walk and talk. For better and for worse I 
have practically been raised off of games from the 1980's to present day. There 
is something I enjoy about having a fixed set of rules to work by in order to achieve 
various tasks. It makes you think in a different way to how you would think in real life.
You start to understand and internalize the quirks of every game's game engine to 
best realize your goals within said game. 

I have always been curious about how these miraculous devices could function. There was 
something so captivating about taking a plastic game console cartridge, slotting 
it into the system, and having something like Yoshi's Island appear on your television 
screen ready to play! This didn't work if you tried stuffing something like a 
peanut-butter and jelly sandwich into the cartridge slot, so what gives? What gave 
these cartridges their power to control the beast that lay inside of the console's 
outer shell?

Fortunately/unfortunately the internet was still not very prominent in my household. 
<maybe add a subtext thing about this here?>
****I vividly remember a time where my dad and I were trying to install Diablo II on 
PC from disk, and it required a constant internet connection to grab the necessary 
1's and 0's for the game to function. If the process was interrupted in any way, then 
the whole thing needed to be restarted. It took 2 weeks of continuous connection for 
the game to be installed (and we had it fail many times)... 
****
I didn't really understand at the time how to utilize the internet to get useful 
information out of it, and it was flakey and strange anyways. Why not just find 
things out for yourself or not question it and keep going with your life? 

Now I wouldn't say that I wasted my early years with gaming and generally being a 
recluse (though I would like to think a partially well-mannered one who didn't cause 
tooooo much trouble usually). I was always a very direction-less indecisive type of 
person growing up. I never found something that really interested me in a way that 
would inspire me to do work. Sure I worked still and I knew that I enjoyed playing video 
games, but I was always surrounded by the idea that video gaming was a juvenile activity 
and you really should become something more practical. I was just going through the 
motions in life. Nothing really caught my eye or interested me. I felt like the only 
real resources I had to work with were my videogames, books, and movies. But this is 
a very 'consumer' type lifestyle and I wanted to create new wonderful things! I just 
didn't know how to in a meaningful way. 

I only realized going into college that I could actually aspire towards creating 
things like videogames. As I explored 'software development' as a possible field 
of study, I came to realize that this ability reached past videogames into being 
able to code ANYTHING* you could imagine! The possibilities where endless!
I always thought this power was reserved only for the savant engineers of the ancient world, 
being something unattainable to the common people. I just never made the connection that 
software was a viable career option and at the time I didn't really understand what 
software development even meant or how it all worked, so I went with my gut and decided 
to start studying for a degree in CS. I never chose CS for any reason other than 
to develop a better understanding of the systems I used daily.




HOBBY ABOUT:




~~~~What was your journey to becoming a professional in what you do?~~~~
I started my professional journey relatively recently (starting in college) after being lost and not knowing what I really wanted to do for most of my life, I realized that I had been working with computers my whole life and I should play towards my strengths. I was always curious about how things worked and I always wanted to discover

~~~~What are your inspirations? Where do you find inspiration?~~~~
I found a lot of inspiration for coding to come from my first technical job at the 
InterOperability Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire. Many of the people 
working there convinced me that coding and working hard in general could actually be fun.
A lot of inspiration was drawn from certain sensational characters at this job that I will never forget 
and I owe a great deal to. These people showed me that it was okay to not know everything, 
reach out for help, but also stay firm in your work and not to give up, even when 
things look hopeless. 

~~~~What motivates you to do what you do?~~~~

~~~~What is your favorite part about being a software developer?~~~~


~~~~Favorite books which relate to your profession:~~~~
The Soul of a New Machine: This book really speaks to me as someone who has really 
given their entire being to get a project to work given a soul crushing workload 
and a seemingly impossible task within a relatively short amount of time (many times). 
I find myself relating to many of the computer engineers of the 'Eagle' system in 
how they felt and worked on problems-------

The Silmarillion: This is not a book that relates to my profession directly, but I think 
unraveling the history and story of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth displays skills which 
translate to software development pretty well. This being one of my favorite books shows 
that I enjoy untangling seeming insurmountable------




Coding Interests:
I enjoy working on large coding projects generally. Most of the work I have accomplished 
has been done from the ground-up (assignments, work projects, personal projects), though 
I have experience in supporting older large-scale code bases.




Hobby Interests:
-Archery
-Oil Painting
-Miniature Painting
-Music (played and sung)
-Electrical - (HACK System, SplitFlaps, etc.)
-Languages (French and German)
-BoardGaming
-Tolkien
-Old Tech
-Roguelike Development
-Beekeeping
