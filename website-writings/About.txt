About:
My name is Noah Wilder: I love software development (other things).

One of my greatest joys in life is learning how things work and solving problems.
The more intimidating or difficult a problem is, the harder I will strive towards 
understanding and solving that problem. This ambition naturally attracted me to 
the field of Computer Science and coding. I enjoy continuously learning and solving 
the problems that come about from coding, as well as making those solutions as 
supportable and clean as possible, while also squeezing the best performance from 
a given system possible.

"For fortune and glory, kid. For fortune and glory..."

I am continually fascinated by the use of abstraction in computing to achieve some of 
the most impressive feats in human history.

Being raised by videogame consoles from 1985-present [yes I had a very fortunate 
childhood in this regard] as well as getting into PC gaming with Diablo II, I have 
always been curious about how these miraculous devices could function. There was 
something so captivating about taking a plastic game console cartridge, slotting 
it into the system, and having something like Yoshi's Island appear on your television 
screen ready to play! 

I only realized going into college that I could actually aspire towards creating 
things like videogames. As I explored 'software development' as a possible field 
of study, I came to realize that this ability reached past videogames into being 
able to code ANYTHING* you could imagine! The possibilities where endless!
I always thought this power was reserved only for the savant engineers of the ancient world, 
being something unattainable to the common people. I just never made the connection that 
software was a viable career option and at the time I didn't really understand what 
software development even meant or how it all worked, so I went with my gut and decided 
to start studying for a degree in CS. I never chose CS for any reason other than 
to develop a better understanding of the systems I used daily.




HOBBY ABOUT:




~~~~What was your journey to becoming a professional in what you do?~~~~
I started my professional journey relatively recently (starting in college) after being lost and not knowing what I really wanted to do for most of my life, I realized that I had been working with computers my whole life and I should play towards my strengths. I was always curious about how things worked and I always wanted to discover

~~~~What are your inspirations? Where do you find inspiration?~~~~
I found a lot of inspiration for coding to come from my first technical job at the 
InterOperability Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire. Many of the people 
working there convinced me that coding and working hard in general could actually be fun.
A lot of inspiration was drawn from certain sensational characters at this job that I will never forget 
and I owe a great deal to. These people showed me that it was okay to not know everything, 
reach out for help, but also stay firm in your work and not to give up, even when 
things look hopeless. 

~~~~What motivates you to do what you do?~~~~

~~~~What is your favorite part about being a software developer?~~~~


~~~~Favorite books which relate to your profession:~~~~
The Soul of a New Machine: This book really speaks to me as someone who has really 
given their entire being to get a project to work given a soul crushing workload 
and a seemingly impossible task within a relatively short amount of time (many times). 
I find myself relating to many of the computer engineers of the 'Eclipse' system in 
how they felt and worked on problems-------

The Silmarillion: This is not a book that relates to my profession directly, but I think 
unraveling the history and story of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth displays skills which 
translate to software development pretty well. This being one of my favorite books shows 
that I enjoy untangling seeming insurmountable------




Coding Interests:
I enjoy working on large coding projects generally. Most of the work I have accomplished 
has been done from the ground-up (assignments, work projects, personal projects), though 
I have experience in supporting older large-scale code bases.




Hobby Interests:
-Archery
-Oil Painting
-Miniature Painting

-Languages (French and German)
-BoardGaming
