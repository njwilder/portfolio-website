                I am continually fascinated by the use of abstraction in computing to achieve some of 
                the most impressive feats in human history.

                I have been a video game junky since I could walk and talk. For better and for worse I 
                have practically been raised off of games from the 1980's to present day. There 
                is something I enjoy about having a fixed set of rules to work by in order to achieve 
                various tasks. It makes you think in a different way to how you would think in real life.
                You start to understand and internalize the quirks of every game's game engine to 
                best realize your goals within said game.

                I have always been curious about how these miraculous devices could function. There was 
                something so captivating about taking a plastic game console cartridge, slotting 
                it into the system, and having something like Yoshi's Island appear on your television 
                screen ready to play! This didn't work if you tried stuffing something like a 
                peanut-butter and jelly sandwich into the cartridge slot, so what gives? What gave 
                these cartridges their power to control the beast that lay inside of the console's 
                outer shell?
                <br>
                <br>
                Now I wouldn't say that I wasted my early years with gaming and generally being a 
                recluse (though I would like to think a partially well-mannered one who didn't cause 
                tooooo much trouble usually). I was always a very direction-less indecisive type of 
                person growing up. I never found something that really interested me in a way that 
                would inspire me to do work. Sure I worked still and I knew that I enjoyed playing video 
                games, but I was always surrounded by the idea that video gaming was a juvenile activity 
                and nothing more. I was just going through the motions in life. Nothing really caught my 
                eye or interested me. I felt like the only real resources I had to work with were my 
                videogames, books, and movies. But this is a very 'consumer' type lifestyle and I wanted 
                to create things! I just didn't know how to in a meaningful way. I never truly understood 
                what my options were or where I could go and what I could do in life.
                <br>
                <br>
                I only realized going into college that I could actually aspire towards creating 
                things like videogames. As I explored 'software development' as a possible field 
                of study, I came to realize that this ability reached past videogames into being 
                able to code ANYTHING* you could imagine! The possibilities where endless!
                I always thought this power was reserved only for the savant engineers of the ancient world, 
                being something unattainable to the common people. I just never made the connection that 
                software was a viable career option and at the time I didn't really understand what 
                software development even meant or how it all worked, so I went with my gut and decided 
                to start studying for a degree in CS. There was something about software development that 
                tickled the same parts of my brain that videogames did. It felt like you were working 
                within a game, you are internalizing the quirks software development computer architecture 
                to design whatever you (or your employer) fancies. It was fantastic!
                <br>
                <br>
                A couple of years into college, I decided I wanted to get serious about software development 
                and improving myself as a person, so I ended up applying and being hired by UNH's InterOperability 
                Laboratory (IOL). I was intimidated by the fact that I didn't know anything about coding, and shown 
                for certain that I was a hopelessly lost and terrible software designer. 
                However, with fantastic bosses and coworkers, I evolved into a truly passionate and hardworking 
                developer. I wasn't motivated by the money I was earning, but the truly fantastic environment and 
                the tons and tons of knowledge and experience I was getting daily. I was in love with the 
                work and the people I worked with. I voluntarily took insane 60-80 hour work weeks while in 
                full-time college (regrettably opting to sacrifice my grades chasing this new working high 
                in my life among other things). I would accidentally pull all-nighters at my work troubleshooting strange 
                Over Fabrics drive issues, or bizzare specification details within cryptic drive tests. 
                I felt truly free at my work, something I never really felt in my personal life except with 
                things like video games. My coworkers and bosses grew concerned, but I assured them I was 
                having the time of my life. And I really was having the time of my life! I felt truly 
                alive deep in my work's server room troubleshooting long after the last employee of the 
                lab had left the building. Coding became like an artform to me, a strange form of expression 
                which allowed you to perform literal magic against these strange pieces of silicon and various 
                metals. It felt like every word or expression you created was like you pouring your very being 
                into the machine.
                <br>
                <br>
                I felt comfortable with the machines. They were always there and 
                they each had their own colorful personalities. The constant humming and whirring of the systems 
                was attractive to me. It felt like I was making some difference. I was a productive person and I 
                would like to think I had worked myself to a position of being important to my department. But I 
                also enjoyed teaching others this new artform I had discovered. Everyone else I had encountered 
                never seemed lost like I was, but I could relate to them in being lost by the work and the 
                specifications we worked extensively with. This was like the glue that kept us all together, the 
                idea of this specification and a test plan created by the higher powers which we needed to obey.
                It made no sense and too much sense at the same time. It was such an intimidating set of documents 
                to work under, especially if it was your first time dealing with a specification (which to many 
                including me, it was). 
                <br>
                <br>
                I liked to spread the idea that it was okay to not understand everything or even anything as long 
                as you were working towards understanding and bettering yourself. I can't stand the idea of not 
                trying to improve yourself and your abilities daily. This is somewhat hypocritical given my 
                meandering upbringing only being enlightened to this idea of self improvement relatively recently, 
                however I believe it to be one of the keys to being truly satisfied in life, something which I am 
                always seeking out.
