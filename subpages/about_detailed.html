                I have been a video game junky since I could walk and talk. For better and for worse, I 
                have practically been raised off of games from the 1980's to present day. There 
                is something I enjoy about having a fixed set of rules to work by in order to achieve 
                various tasks. It makes you think in a different way to how you would think in real life.
                You start to understand and internalize the quirks of every game's engine to 
                best realize your goals within the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been curious about how these miraculous devices could function. There was 
                something so captivating about taking a plastic game console cartridge, slotting 
                it into the system, and having something like Yoshi's Island appear on your television 
                screen ready to play! This didn't work if you tried stuffing something like a 
                peanut-butter and jelly sandwich into the cartridge slot (I have tested this, much 
                to the dismay of my parents), so what gives? What gave these cartridges their power 
                to control the beast that lay inside of the console's outer shell? And how was this machine 
                able to tell which game to play?
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, I didn't take this curiosity past shrugging and continuing my insane 
                gaming binges. I was curious, but early on in my life I didn't realize that I could mess 
                around with the world around me and learn using the resources available to me. 
                It's hard looking back and trying to explain why I couldn't become passionate about 
                anything early on. It's like I didn't know that I could learn. Imagine living like that?! 
                I can blame the failings of the modern education system and events that happened early in my life,
                however at the end of the day everyone has their demons and it's inconsiderate to think that 
                even you, the reader, haven't been through some terrible things to get to where you are today. 
                It is clich√© to say, however it really is how you carry yourself after these events which defines 
                you as a person.

                So let's skip past my early life and jump to college. I originally started at 
                'Southern New Hampshire University' (SNHU) through their online program, however, in a defining 
                moment which would have strong impacts towards my future, I decided I wanted to transfer to 
                an in-person campus instead of getting my degree online. I felt a strong detatchment from the rest of 
                humanity and I knew the path I was currently following wasn't what I wanted. 
                I also felt like the online learning environment wasn't for me.
                If I was going to be paying for some sort of education, I should do it right and 
                fully commit to the education I wanted. I decided to change my life trajectory 
                and transfer to the 'University of New Hampshire' (UNH). It is funny, but this feels like 
                one of the first real decisions I have ever made in my life. I look back now and it seems 
                like I was always taking the path of least resistance, kind of plodding along. 
                It's all so strange looking back trying to make sense of the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't know what college was going to be like. I felt charismatic and my literacy 
                felt above average for my age. I was armed with a lot of essoteric knowledge from past 
                experience and research, but I was also very self aware and not confident in myself. 
                I felt very weak in many areas people wouldn't normally feel weak in, such as: finance, 
                math, structured lifestyle, etc.. I felt like I needed to go through some sort of crucible 
                to prove to myself that I was worthy. I only had sneaking suspicions that I 
                had what it took, but I didn't know who I was or what I was capable of doing. 
                College seemed like a safe place to find out how far I could push myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I only realized going into college that I could actually aspire towards creating 
                things like videogames. As I explored 'software development' as a possible field 
                of study, I came to realize that this ability reached past videogames into being 
                able to code ANYTHING* you could imagine! The possibilities where endless!
                I thought this power was reserved for the savant engineers of the ancient world, 
                being something unattainable to mere mortals. I just never made the connection that 
                software was a viable career option, and at the time I didn't really understand what 
                software development even meant or how it all worked. I decided to go with my gut feeling and 
                started studying for a degree in Computer Science. There was something about software development that 
                tickled the same parts of my brain that videogames did. It felt like you were working 
                within a game, you are internalizing the quirks of software development and computer architecture 
                to design whatever you (or your employer) fancies. It was fantastic! It made me feel like I was 
                actually in control of something.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a couple years in college, I decided that I wanted to work harder than I already was 
                and get a second job (I was already working as a librarian at this time). 
                A good option seemed to be UNH's InterOperability Laboratory. I applied to the IOL, 
                was interviewed, and ended up getting hired as a part of the lab's Datacenter team! 
                I absolutely fell in love with the IOL and many of the people that worked there. I never felt 
                so happy working as I did at 'the lab', as its inhabitants affectionately called it. 
                I was simply intoxicated by the learning and hands-on experience available when I 
                joined. Since I was hired during the Covid-19 quarantine at a time when everyone at work 
                was remote, I had the perfect environment to start working in-person with just me and my 
                bosses. I felt free to ask questions, tinker with machines around the office, and spend 
                time pouring over specifications and test procedures for NVMe PCIe SSDs. I really enjoy 
                working in-person as possible, so it felt like the perfect storm coming into my first tech 
                related job. I felt like what I was learning on the job was infinitely more valuable than 
                from my formal education, so I would spend more and more time at the lab. This extended 
                into weekends, holidays, etc.. I was having the time of my life and working harder than I 
                have ever worked in my life.

            <p>
                Long story cut short, I worked flat-out for 2 years straight while attending college full-time, 
                but events in my personal life during the last few months of my time at the lab started 
                taking their toll on my mental and physical health and I felt like I didn't have any support. At 
                the time I had worked myself up to be a 'silver bullet' employee at the lab, though I was tempered 
                extremely by my humility and my general glee at working on solutions to problems. I was always 
                not confident in myself or my ability, but I like to think my hard work and sheer effort on 
                problems got our department and I through a lot of difficult times.
                I realized that nobody I worked with cared about me or anything other than themselves, and that 
                was a crushing realization to me that I couldn't quite recover from. I observed the people around me 
                and things became too toxic. The work environment deteriorated into 
                something I just didn't want to be a part of. I also came under extremely heavy burnout from 
                constant 80 hour weeks (not counting college) for 6 months to a year straight. I made the unfortunate decision to ignore 
                myself and continue my work at break-neck pace for another 6 months before reaching my breaking 
                limit with the job and the people there. I decided to quit and take some time to recouperate 
                and get back in touch with many of the things I had sacrificed for the job, and the 
                people / pets I had put by the wayside during this time. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                My time at the IOL was unbelievably impactful to me. I learned so much I wouldn't have 
                been able to through UNH normally. I built my knowledge of many foundational skills and got 
                hands-on experience working with others I consider way more capable and intelligent than myself. 
                It was an honor, and even though my experience was soured by the end of my time with the IOL, 
                it was ultimately an excellent influence on me. I was able to develop and refine my work ethic 
                and character in an accepting environment full of opportunity and generosity. I found that it 
                was okay to not know anything, or to be confused, so long as you were asking questions and moving 
                towards understanding every day. In this way, you can become reliable and knowledgable 
                within any field given time and continual effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am able to see through this mess of negativity and recognize that the IOL's vision and general workmanship 
                was a cause worth fighting for and worth 2 years of complete dedication from me. I had found my limit and I had 
                proven to myself that I was able to learn many things if I could put my mind to them. I also 
                found that I was capable of spending long hours working towards goals without losing hope 
                or determination. I have also found a passion in computer programming and computation in 
                general, which I never knew I could have about anything in this world before!
            </p>

            <p>
                Coming into college, I felt like I had been reborn! I picked up many hobbies and skills I always 
                wanted to try but never felt like I was worthy of, or could excel in. I took up archery, roller-skating, 
                Oil painting (plein air during college, subject painting coming out of college), miniature painting, 
                playing guitar, beekeeping, electrical engineering hobby work. I also found coding and software design to be fun 
                even after coding all day at work! I really enjoy having a bunch of pokers in the fire and 
                juggling different projects all the time!
            </p>
            <p>
                After the IOL, there isn't too much to update you on which can't be seen through the projects I have 
                in my 'projects' section. I am working on a few projects semi-secretly which I am 
                excited to be able to present when they become presentable! As was alluded to above, 
                I decided to spend some time reconnecting with myself. I have spent 
                my time reading, writing, coding, traveling, playing music, painting, and generally exploring 
                the world around me. I have put a big focus on helping family and trying to spend as much 
                time with them as I can. I have a few plans for the future, one of which is to continue onward 
                towards a Master's in Computer Science at UNH!

                Since I can't resist, I will share a couple of my paintings I have done. I don't have any formal 
                training in painting, and Oil paint as a medium is something I still do not have too much 
                experience with. All of my paintings tend to have some sort of 'challenge' tied with them 
                to help me learn more and (hopefully) improve a little bit at a time.

                    "Jasper": This is a triadic portrait painting of a coworker's adorable dog Jasper which I was inspired 
                    to paint! At this point, I had only done landscape paintings in oil and I tried an 
                    interesting image transfer technique. This painting took a while, but I had a lot of fun 
                    enjoying the process and learning how to use just 3 colors to paint with. I wanted 
                    to focus on the shapes and main features I saw from the reference photo.

                    "Scully": This is a monochromatic portait painting of Scully from the X-Files in red. I was really inspired to 
                    do a pair of paintings of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (Fox Mulder and Dana Scully respectively) 
                    with Mulder in blue and Scully in red. I started with Mulder's painting, but I never ended up 
                    finishing it. The Scully portrait I ended up banging out in an afternoon using a prepainting 
                    drawing method with heavily thinned oil paint, before painting in subsequently thicker layers. 
                    There are flaws to the portrait but I think the likeness is good considering. 
                    I wanted to focus on painting value as opposed to color.

                    "Cpt. Kirk": Returning back to color, I spent a considerable number of weeks off-and-on working 
                    on this portrait. I spent such a long time trying to get the face the way I wanted that 
                    I ended up deciding to not texture the body to draw the attention towards the shifting values 
                    of the face. I had a lot of trouble going from the Scully picture back to using many different 
                    types of colors again while also trying to respect value. Every time I felt like I was close 
                    to done, I realized the color was not quite how I liked it and I would keep iterating over it. 
                    I learned that you shouldn't outright ban certain colors because of your preconceived notions, 
                    for instance this face has a great deal of green in it! Colors are fascinating and it is 
                    extremely interesting to see how the meaning of a color you put down on the canvas can actually 
                    change depending on colors around it.

                    given their entire being to get a project to work given a soul crushing workload
                    and a seemingly impossible task within a relatively short amount of time (many times).
                    I find myself relating to many of the computer engineers of the 'Eagle' system in
                    how they felt and worked on problems. I felt like I was really unique in my experiences 
                    and my feelings towards these machines before sitting down and reading this book. I had come to 
                    discover that there where other sick and twisted individuals out there who enjoyed working way 
                    past the call of duty on a project. I especially enjoy chapter 5: "Midnight Programmer" due to how 
                    cathartic and relatable it is to me and my work, the entire book in general is extremely relatable 
                    and entertaining to read through! I would give anything to be able to read it for the first time again!

                    <span class="bold">'The Elements of Computing Systems' by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken</span>: Before reading this book, 
                    I felt like I never had a proper idea of how computers actually work. I had gone through 
                    my entire time at college and the IOL working with these mystical electrical contraptions, and 
                    yet, I felt like I wasn't any closer to understanding how these systems were 
                    actually processing the code I wrote under the hood. Working through this book finally made 
                    a lot of computing 'click' for me. I more clearly understand why instruction sets 
                    are a thing, how electrical signals in a system can move a character on a screen, and many
                    other aspects of computers. I believe it is important to know at least something about the hardware you
                    are trying to control to become a better developer. I wish I read this book before I
                    started college so I wasn't so hung up on the "why"s of computer science. I 
                    became so interested in it, that I ended up attempting to create the system outlined in the 
                    book physically, starting at first with breadboards and wires, but settling with actually 
                    designing custom PCBs for a more "permanent" setup! This project will appear in the 'Projects' 
                    section when it becomes more presentable.

                    <span class="bold">'The Silmarillion' by J. R. R. Tolkien (edited and published posthumously by Christopher Tolkien)</span>: 
                    The Silmarillion reads a lot like the Christian Bible, but from the perspective of the Elves of 
                    Middle-Earth. It deals with many of the Gods and events that took place before 'The Hobbit' and 
                    'The Lord of the Rings', with these events being mentioned as more of a footnote at the end of 
                    the Silmarillion rather than being center stage. Long before 'the Ring' and even hobbits, 
                    there was Melkor (later to be referred to as 'Morgoth', or 'the Black Foe'/'Dark Tyrant') 
                    and the Silmarils. This is not a book that relates to my profession directly, however I believe
                    unraveling the history and story of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth displays skills which
                    translate to software development pretty well. This being one of my favorite books shows
                    that I enjoy untangling seemingly insurmountable networks of character associations and
                    lore. I find the Silmarillion to be much like a software system in that there are many
                    components in the narrative which work together to produce a relatively coherent product. 
                    It requires some natural obsessiveness to work through, which I feel is shared among
                    passionate software developers. Also the story generally blows my socks off every time I read it.
