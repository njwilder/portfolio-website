                I am continually fascinated by the use of abstraction in computing to achieve some of 
                the most impressive feats in human history.

                I have been a video game junky since I could walk and talk. For better and for worse, I 
                have practically been raised off of games from the 1980's to present day. There 
                is something I enjoy about having a fixed set of rules to work by in order to achieve 
                various tasks. It makes you think in a different way to how you would think in real life.
                You start to understand and internalize the quirks of every game's engine to 
                best realize your goals within the game.

                I have always been curious about how these miraculous devices could function. There was 
                something so captivating about taking a plastic game console cartridge, slotting 
                it into the system, and having something like Yoshi's Island appear on your television 
                screen ready to play! This didn't work if you tried stuffing something like a 
                peanut-butter and jelly sandwich into the cartridge slot (I have tested this, much 
                to the dismay of my parents), so what gives? What gave these cartridges their power 
                to control the beast that lay inside of the console's outer shell? And how was this machine 
                able to tell which game to play?

                Unfortunately, I didn't take this curiosity past shrugging and continuing my insane 
                gaming binges. I was curious, but early on in my life I didn't realize that I could mess 
                around with the world around me and learn using the resources available all around. 
                It's hard looking back and trying to explain why I couldn't become passionate about 
                anything early on. It's like I didn't know that I could learn. Imagine living like that?! 
                I can blame the failings of the modern education system and events that happened early in my life,
                however at the end of the day everyone has their demons and it's inconsiderate to think that 
                even you, the reader, haven't been through some terrible things to get to where you are today. 
                It is clich√© to say, however it really is how you carry yourself after these events which defines 
                you as a person.
            </p>

                So let's skip past my early life and jump to college. I originally started at 
                'Southern New Hampshire University' (SNHU) through their online program, however, in a defining 
                moment which would have strong impacts towards my future, I decided I wanted to transfer to 
                an in-person campus instead of getting my degree online. I felt a strong detatchment from the rest of 
                humanity and I knew the path I was currently following wasn't what I wanted. 
                I also felt like the online learning environment wasn't for me.
                If I was going to be paying for some sort of education, I should do it right and 
                fully commit to the education I wanted. I decided to change my life trajectory 
                and transfer to the 'University of New Hampshire' (UNH). It is funny, but this feels like 
                one of the first real decisions I have ever made in my life. I look back now and it seems 
                like I was always taking the path of least resistance, kind of plodding along towards 
                nothing. It's all so strange looking back trying to make sense of the past.

                I didn't know what college was going to be like. I felt charismatic and my literacy 
                felt above average for my age. I was armed with a lot of essoteric knowledge from past 
                experience and research, but I was also very self aware and not confident in myself. 
                I felt very weak in many areas people wouldn't normally feel weak in, such as: finance, 
                math, structured lifestyle, etc.. I felt like I needed to go through some sort of crucible 
                to prove to myself that I was worthy. I only had sneaking suspicions that I 
                had what it took, but I didn't know who I was or what I was capable of doing. 
                College seemed like a safe place to find out how far I could push myself.

                I only realized going into college that I could actually aspire towards creating 
                things like videogames. As I explored 'software development' as a possible field 
                of study, I came to realize that this ability reached past videogames into being 
                able to code ANYTHING* you could imagine! The possibilities where endless!
                I thought this power was reserved for the savant engineers of the ancient world, 
                being something unattainable to mere mortals. I just never made the connection that 
                software was a viable career option, and at the time I didn't really understand what 
                software development even meant or how it all worked. I decided to go with my gut feeling and 
                started studying for a degree in Computer Science. There was something about software development that 
                tickled the same parts of my brain that videogames did. It felt like you were working 
                within a game, you are internalizing the quirks of software development and computer architecture 
                to design whatever you (or your employer) fancies. It was fantastic! It made me feel like I was 
                actually in control of something.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a couple years in college, I decided that I wanted to work harder than I already was 
                and get a second job (I was already working as a librarian at this time). 
                A good option seemed to be UNH's InterOperability Laboratory, which I 
                applied to, was interviewed, and was hired for! More about this is explained in the 
                <a href="../projects/iol.html">'IOL projects section'</a> if you are interested! I ended 
                up falling in love with the IOL and many of the people that worked there. I never felt 
                so happy working as I did at 'the lab', as its inhabitants affectionately called it. 
                Long story cut short in favor of differring it to its own section, I worked flat-out for 
                2 years straight while attending college fulltime, but events in my personal life during 
                the last couple months of my time at 'the lab' started taking their toll on me mentally and 
                physically and I ultimately felt like my dedication and hard work was being taken for 
                granted by everyone around me. I realized I needed to take more care of myself for a change 
                and leave my work. I decided to quit and take some time to recouperate and get back in touch 
                with many of the things I had sacrificed for the job, and the people / pets I had put by 
                the wayside during this time. I had found my limit and I had proven to myself that I was 
                able to learn many things if I could put my mind to them. I also found that I was capable 
                of spending long hours working towards goals without losing hope or determination, and 
                I have found a passion in computer programming and computation in general, which I never 
                knew I could have about something in this world! My time at the IOL was unbelievably 
                impactful to me. I learned so much I wouldn't have been able to through UNH normally. 
                I built my knowledge of many foundational skills and got hands-on experience working 
                with others I consider way more capable and intelligent than myself. It was an honor, 
                and even though my experience was soured by the end of my time there, the IOL was a 
                great influence on me and helped me develop my work ethic and character.

                Coming into college, I felt like I had been reborn! I picked up many hobbies and skills I always 
                wanted to try but never felt like I was worthy of, or could excel in. I took up archery, roller-skating, 
                Oil painting (plein air during college, subject painting coming out of college), miniature painting, 
                playing guitar, beekeeping, electrical engineering hobby work. I also found coding and software design to be a fun 
                hobby I enjoyed working at even after coding all day long at work. I really enjoy having a bunch of pokers in 
                the fire and juggling different projects all the time! It felt like a good way to keep sane 
                was to constantly be improving myself and my knowledge while working on the CS curriculum (which 
                can be brutal while working two jobs).

                After 'the lab', there isn't too much to update you on which can't be seen through the projects I have 
                in my 'projects' section. I am working on a few projects semi-secretly which I am 
                excited to be able to present when they become presentable!

                <br>
                <span class="bold">A:</span> I really enjoy problem solving. The feeling of getting your vision working the way 
                you want is out of this world! I like building complex systems from smaller lower-level 
                concepts and implementations to create things that genuinely impact the world, even if it 
                is a small impact!
                <br>
                A close second would be collaborating with other devlopers. I really like getting to know 
                others and seeing their solutions to programming problems. I enjoy weighing different 
                solutions to problems which I might have not even thought about.

                <span class="bold">The Soul of a New Machine</span> by Tracy Kidder: This book really speaks to me as someone who has really
                given their entire being to get a project to work given a soul crushing workload
                and a seemingly impossible task within a relatively short amount of time (many times).
                I find myself relating to many of the computer engineers of the 'Eagle' system in
                how they felt and worked on problems. I felt like I was really unique in my experiences 
                and my feelings towards these machines before sitting down and reading this book. I had come to 
                discover that there where other sick and twisted individuals out there who enjoyed working way 
                past the call of duty on a project. I especially enjoy chapter 5: "Midnight Programmer" due to how 
                cathartic and relatable it is to me and my work, the entire book in general is extremely relatable 
                and entertaining to read through! I would give anything to be able to read it for the first time again!

                <span class="bold">The Elements of Computing Systems</span> by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken: Before reading this book, 
                I felt like I never quite got a proper idea of how computers actually work. I had gone through 
                my entire time at college and the IOL working with these mystical electrical contraptions and 
                yet I felt like I was not really any closer to understanding just how these systems were 
                actually processing the code I wrote under the hood. Working through this book finally made 
                a lot of computing 'click' for me. I now more clearly understand why instruction sets 
                are a thing, how electrical signals in a system can move a character on a screen, and many
                other aspects of computers. I believe it is important to know at least something about the hardware you
                are trying to control with code to become a better developer. I wished I had read this book before I
                started college or else I might have been less hung up on the "why"s of computer science. I 
                became so interested in it, that I ended up attempting to create the system outlined in the 
                book physically, starting at first with breadboards and wires, but settling with actually 
                designing custom PCBs for a more "perminant" setup! This project will appear in the 'Projects' 
                section when it becomes more presentable.

                <span class="bold">The Silmarillion</span> by J. R. R. Tolkien (edited and published posthumously by Christopher Tolkien): 
                The Silmarillion reads a lot like the Christian Bible, but from the perspective of the Elves of 
                Middle-Earth. It deals with many of the Gods and events that took place before 'The Hobbit' and 
                'The Lord of the Rings', with these events being mentioned as more of a footnote at the end of 
                the Silmarillion rather than being center stage. Long before 'the Ring' and even hobbits, 
                there was Melkor (later to be referred to as 'Morgoth', or 'the Black Foe'/'Dark Tyrant') 
                and the Silmarils. This is not a book that relates to my profession directly, however I believe
                unraveling the history and story of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth displays skills which
                translate to software development pretty well. This being one of my favorite books shows
                that I enjoy untangling seemingly insurmountable networks of character associations and
                lore. I find the Silmarillion to be much like a software system in that there are many
                components in the narrative which work together to produce a relatively coherent narrative
                (product). It requires some natural obsessiveness to work through which I feel is shared among
                passionate software developers. Also the story generally blows my socks off every time I read it.
