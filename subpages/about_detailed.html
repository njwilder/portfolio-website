                I am continually fascinated by the use of abstraction in computing to achieve some of 
                the most impressive feats in human history.

                I have been a video game junky since I could walk and talk. For better and for worse, I 
                have practically been raised off of games from the 1980's to present day. There 
                is something I enjoy about having a fixed set of rules to work by in order to achieve 
                various tasks. It makes you think in a different way to how you would think in real life.
                You start to understand and internalize the quirks of every game's engine to 
                best realize your goals within the game.

                I have always been curious about how these miraculous devices could function. There was 
                something so captivating about taking a plastic game console cartridge, slotting 
                it into the system, and having something like Yoshi's Island appear on your television 
                screen ready to play! This didn't work if you tried stuffing something like a 
                peanut-butter and jelly sandwich into the cartridge slot (I have tested this, much 
                to the dismay of my parents), so what gives? What gave these cartridges their power 
                to control the beast that lay inside of the console's outer shell? And how was this machine 
                able to tell which game to play?

                Unfortunately, I didn't take this curiosity past shrugging and continuing my insane 
                gaming binges. I was curious, but early on in my life I didn't realize that I could mess 
                around with the world around me and learn using the resources available all around. 
                It's hard looking back and trying to explain why I couldn't become passionate about 
                anything early on. It's like I didn't know that I could learn. Imagine living like that?! 
                I can blame the failings of the modern education system and events that happened early in my life,
                however at the end of the day everyone has their demons and it's inconsiderate to think that 
                even you, the reader, haven't been through some terrible things to get to where you are today. 
                It is clich√© to say, however it really is how you carry yourself after these events which defines 
                you as a person.

                So let's skip past my early life and jump to college. I originally started at 
                'Southern New Hampshire University' (SNHU) through their online program, however, in a defining 
                moment which would have strong impacts towards my future, I pulled my mom aside one day and 
                expressed how I felt it was important for me to transfer to an in-person campus 
                instead of getting my degree online. I felt my strong detatchment from the rest of 
                humanity and I knew the path I was currently following led to stagnation, or at most a 
                lesser life than what I wanted. I also felt like the online learning environment was mediocre at best 
                and if I was going to be paying for some sort of education, I should do it right and 
                fully commit to the education I wanted. I decided that day to change my life trajectory 
                and transfer to the 'University of New Hampshire' (UNH). It is funny, but this feels like 
                one of the first real decisions I have ever made in my life. I look back now and it seems 
                like I was always taking the path of least resistance, kind of plodding along towards 
                nothing. It's all so strange looking back trying to make sense of the past.

                I didn't know what college was going to be like. I felt charismatic and my literacy 
                felt above average for my age. I was armed with a lot of essoteric knowledge from past 
                experience and research, but I was also very self aware and unconfident in myself. 
                I felt very weak in many areas people wouldn't normally feel weak in, such as: finance, 
                math, structured lifestyle, etc.. I felt like I needed to go through some sort of crucible 
                to prove to myself that I was worthy. I only had sneaking suspicions that I 
                had what it took, but I didn't know who I was or what I was capable of doing. 
                College seemed like a safe place to find out how far I could push myself.

                I only realized going into college that I could actually aspire towards creating 
                things like videogames. As I explored 'software development' as a possible field 
                of study, I came to realize that this ability reached past videogames into being 
                able to code ANYTHING* you could imagine! The possibilities where endless!
                I always thought this power was reserved only for the savant engineers of the ancient world, 
                being something unattainable to the common people. I just never made the connection that 
                software was a viable career option, and at the time I didn't really understand what 
                software development even meant or how it all worked, so I went with my gut and decided 
                to start studying for a degree in CS. There was something about software development that 
                tickled the same parts of my brain that videogames did. It felt like you were working 
                within a game, you are internalizing the quirks of software development and computer architecture 
                to design whatever you (or your employer) fancies. It was fantastic! It made me feel like I was 
                actually in control of something.

                After a couple years in college, I decided that I wanted to work harder than I already was 
                and get a second job (I was already working as a librarian at this time). 
                A good option seemed to be UNH's InterOperability Laboratory, which I 
                applied for, was interviewed, and was hired for! More about this is explained in the 
                <a href="../projects/iol.html">'IOL projects section'</a> if you are interested! I ended 
                up falling in love with the IOL and many of the people that worked there. I never felt 
                so happy working as I did at 'the lab', as its inhabitants affectionately called it. 
                Long story cut short in favor of differring it to its own section, I worked flat-out for 
                2 years straight while attending college fulltime, but events in my personal life during 
                the last couple months of my time at 'the lab' started taking their toll on me mentally and 
                physically and I ultimately felt like my dedication and hard work was being taken for 
                granted by everyone around me. I realized I needed to take more care of myself for a change 
                and leave my work. I decided to quit and take some time to recouperate and get back in touch with many of the things 
                I had sacrificed for the job, and the people / pets I had put by the wayside during this time. 
                I had found my limit and I had proven to myself that I was able to learn many things if 
                I could put my mind to them. I also found that I was capable of spending long hours working 
                towards goals without losing hope or determination, and I have found a passion in computer programming and 
                computation in general, which I never knew I could have about something in this world! My time 
                at the IOL was unbelievably impactful to me. I learned so much I wouldn't have been able to 
                through UNH normally. I built my knowledge of many foundational skills and got hands-on experience 
                working with others I consider way more capable and intelligent than myself. It was an honor, 
                and even though my experience was soured by the end of my time there, the IOL was a 
                great influence on me and helped me develop my work ethic.

                Coming into college, I felt like I had been reborn! I picked up many hobbies and skills I always 
                wanted to try but never felt like I was worthy of, or could excel in. I took up archery, roller-skating, 
                Oil painting (plein air during college, subject painting coming out of college), miniature painting, 
                playing guitar. I also found coding and software design to be a fun hobby I enjoyed working 
                at even after coding all day long at work. I really enjoy having a bunch of pokers in 
                the fire and juggling different projects all the time! It felt like a good way to keep sane 
                was to constantly be improving myself and my knowledge while working on the CS curriculum.

                After 'the lab', there isn't too much to update you on which can't be seen through the projects I have 
                in my 'projects' section. I am working on a few projects semi-secretely which I am 
                excited to be able to present when they become presentable!
