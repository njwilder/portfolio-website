        <p>
            A couple of years into college, I decided I wanted to get serious about software development 
            and improving myself as a person, so I ended up applying and being hired by UNH's InterOperability 
            Laboratory (IOL). I was intimidated by the fact that I didn't know anything about coding, and shown 
            for certain that I was a hopelessly lost and terrible software designer. 
            However, with fantastic bosses and coworkers, I evolved into a truly passionate and hardworking 
            developer. I wasn't motivated by money, but by the truly fantastic environment and 
            the tons and tons of knowledge and experience I was getting daily. I was in love with the 
            work and the people I worked with. I voluntarily took insane 60-80 hour work weeks while in 
            full-time college (regrettably opting to sacrifice my grades chasing this new working high 
            in my life among other things). I would accidentally pull all-nighters at my work troubleshooting strange 
            Over Fabrics drive issues, or bizzare specification details within cryptic drive tests. 
            I felt truly free at my work, something I never really felt in my personal life except with 
            things like video games. My coworkers and bosses grew concerned, but I assured them I was 
            having the time of my life. And I really was having the time of my life! I felt truly 
            alive deep in my work's server room troubleshooting long after the last employee of the 
            lab had left the building. Coding became like an artform to me, a strange form of expression 
            which allowed you to perform literal magic against these strange pieces of silicon and various 
            metals. It felt like every word or expression you created was like you pouring your very being 
            into the machine.

            I felt comfortable with the machines. They were always there and 
            they each had their own colorful personalities. The constant humming and whirring of the systems 
            was attractive to me. It felt like I was making some difference. I was a productive person and I 
            would like to think I had worked myself to a position of being important to my department. But I 
            also enjoyed teaching others this new artform I had discovered. Everyone else I had encountered 
            never seemed lost like I was, but I could relate to them in being lost by the work and the 
            specifications we worked extensively with. This was like the glue that kept us all together, the 
            idea of this specification and a test plan created by the higher powers which we needed to obey.
            It made no sense and too much sense at the same time. It was such an intimidating set of documents 
            to work under, especially if it was your first time dealing with a specification (which to many 
            including me, it was). 
        </p>
        <p>
            I liked to spread the idea that it was okay to not understand everything or even anything as long 
            as you were working towards understanding and bettering yourself. I can't stand the idea of not 
            trying to improve yourself and your abilities daily. This is somewhat hypocritical given my 
            meandering upbringing only being enlightened to this idea of self improvement relatively recently, 
            however I believe it to be one of the keys to being truly satisfied in life, something which I am 
            always seeking out.
