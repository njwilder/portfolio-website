                    One of my greatest joys in life is solving technical problems. A former librarian and Datacenter lab technician for the University of New Hampshire's 'InterOperability Laboratory', I excel in a strong teamwork oriented programming/debugging environment. I enjoy digging into complex issues and collaborating with others (or working solo utilizing the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber ducky</a>' technique of holding intense technical debates with inanimate objects) to get the job done, and done right&#8482. I have a tendancy to give more weight to supportable and correct code over rushing for a solution and calling it good.
