                I believe it is important to reach out and grab anything that is even remotely 
                interesting to yourself with both hands. I subscribe to the "jack of all trades, 
                master of one" philosiphy where you should strive to try and learn as much about 
                everything as possible. It's probably a good idea to learn more thoroughly in 
                a field of some sort (for me being computing and electrical engineering as more of 
                a hobby), but we should not supress our urge to explore outside of our preconcieved 
                boundries. I am continually fascinated by just how much there is to learn about 
                and experience in this world.
